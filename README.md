## Setup
1. Copy the contents of the platform appropriate `code-workspace.example` file into `ShapeArt.code-workspace`.
2. Install the C++ GoogleTest Adapter extension and choose `Run Tests` as the debug config.

You'll now have launch configuration called Run Tests. This will build and launch the test executable.
